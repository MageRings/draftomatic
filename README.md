# Basic Usage

You can try out a live instance of draftomatic [here](https://draftomatic.herokuapp.com/magic/#/tournament).

## Run:. Run `gulp watch` in `magic-app`.  This will generate the frontend
application.  Node that any changes to HTML files must be accompanied
by a trivial change to `magic-app/bower.json`.  This is a known issue.
4.  Before submitting a pull request, use `./gradlew build` to run tests.
